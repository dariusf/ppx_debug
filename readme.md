- lib: user code to be debugged
- app: frontend for lib, assumed bug-free
- ppx_debug: used when compiling lib to generate tracing code
- ppx_debug_runtime: used at runtime in lib by code generated by ppx_debug
- debug: frontend for reading traces, depends on lib
- ppx_debug_tool: used by debug to read type info produced by compilation of lib

Fills the niche an interactive debugger would fill in other languages

A small, robust framework for _application-level tracing_, intended for exploring and debugging code with complex recursive functions (i.e. PL tools).

Annotate code like this:

```ocaml
let[@trace] f xs =
  List.length xs + 1

let () =
  f ([1] @ [2]) |> ignore
```

and in the resulting trace, you'll see that the function has the argument `[1; 2]` and result `3`.

```bash
echo todo
```

This would be unsurprising in any language other than OCaml, where there is no polymorphic show or runtime type metadata, and because staged_pps isn't being used.

# How it works:

1. User code is first compiled with a (non-staged) ppx to instrument functions. This dumps values using [Marshal](https://ocaml.org/api/Stdlib.Marshal.html).
2. A separate executable is created using a _second_ ppx, which reads the cmt files of the code from step 1 during compilation to figure out how to interpret the dumped values. This is similar to how trace formats like [CTF](https://diamon.org/ctf/) separate trace content from metadata. Specializing this to OCaml, _types_ are not needed to dump values, only to interpret them.
3. The executable from step 2 is run on the trace to either query it or convert it into a form that can be explored using [magic-trace](https://magic-trace.org/) or [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).

# Why do it this way?

- Separating trace content from schema reduces runtime overhead, i.e. there are reasons to do this in other languages, and even with modular implicits.
- Not using staged_pps reduces compilation time when the trace isn't read and allows the use of Dune's instrumentation ([technical limitation](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/instrumentation.html#declaring-an-instrumentation-backend)).
- A form of staging is still used (compiling a dependent second executable), but with a [much more explicit](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts.html#preprocessing-specification) separation of phases that's arguably easier to understand. For example, from the docs, it's not clear if reading the cmt file of a compilation unit during preprocessing is allowed.
- The typechecker is not run twice. This seems hard to avoid with staged_pps as ppx-generated code has to be validated.
- It's unclear if there is sufficient information available at runtime to dump data structures with something like an [instrumented bytecode interpreter](https://ocaml.org/releases/4.14/htmlman/instrumented-runtime.html) or [gdb](https://mshinwell.github.io/libmonda/). The maintenance burden seems higher, though.

# How is this different from...

- [magic-trace](https://github.com/janestreet/magic-trace): performance-oriented, so no support for interpreting app data structures. Intended to be used without recompiling and will show low-level function calls using Intel PT, whereas we require instrumentation in order to be able to display values faithfully and are interested in user code, not libraries.
- [landmarks](https://github.com/LexiFi/landmarks): performance-oriented. Contains a binding to x86/x64 [TSC](https://github.com/LexiFi/landmarks#the-clock-function). We also measure timing but don't focus too much on performance, as magic-trace fills that niche.
- [genprintlib](https://github.com/progman1/genprintlib): uses staged_pps to implement a polymorphic print function, so is an exemplar of that approach.
- [ppx_polyprint](https://github.com/dariusf/ppx_polyprint): precursor to this project.
